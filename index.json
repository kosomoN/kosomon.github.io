The course provided facilities for designing and executing an electronics project over the course of a semester. We designed everything from the analog and digital circuits to the enclosure.\nBoth of the power supply output channels are independent, and have their own galvanically isolated control system. The user interface is running on a Raspberry Pi, which communicates with the power supply channels through an SPI connection through optocouplers.\nDesigned the regulator PCB and two interface PCBs from scratch using KiCAD. We tried out as many PCB manufacturing techniques as possible, including acid etching, CNC routing and we had the regulator PCBs professionally manufactured (not including assembly). Regulator firmware for the AVR microcontroller. Interface software for Raspberry Pi. Physical user interface software as a USB HID. Evaluated the finished power supply against a commercial power supply with similar specifications. Introduction The subject of the project was an adjustable laboratory power supply. Based on the specification, we set out to build a laboratory power supply with a digitally adjustable voltage between 0-24V and a current of 0-2A. The specification changed slightly from the design, as the transformer we chose gives up to 3A power to the two channels. The voltage and current of the final device are adjustable between 0-24V and 0-3A.\nImplemented hardware Features:\nTwo galvanically isolated output channels Voltage range: 0-24V / channel, 48V if connected in series Current range: 0-3A / channel, 6A if connected in parallel Power: 144W Voltage accuracy: ≈ 50mV Current accuracy: ≈ 10mA Outputs: Two / channel, and one for ground Inputs: C13 connector 230V Overheating protection Current limitation Temperature-controlled fan 7” LCD display Keypad and rotary encoder for adjusting settings Controllable through USB The operation of the device is controlled by a single-board computer Raspberry Pi Zero. The user interface is displayed on a 7” LCD and the device can be controlled through either physical keys or over USB.\nLinear Regulator The Raspberry Pi controls two identical regulator circuits using SPI. One such circuit is illustrated in the block diagram below the galvanic isolation line. The circuit has an AVR microcontroller which receives the desired voltage and current limits from the Raspberry Pi. The microcontroller then sends the received voltage and current limits to the DA converter and reads the realized voltage and current from the AD converter. Each circuit has its own optical isolators for the SPI bus and the operating voltages of both circuits are galvanically isolated from each other and from ground. The Raspberry Pi also controls the output relays to disconnect the load if necessary.\nThe circuit diagram for the analog section of the regulator circuit. Regulator PCB for a single channel. The main components of the regulators are:\nComponent Operational Amplifier MAX9944ASA+T Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) MCP3422A0-E/SN Digital to Analog Converter (DAC) MCP4822-E/SN Current Amplifier INA240A1DR Microcontroller ATMEGA328PB-AU The circuit is switched on when a 25-28V (rms) AC voltage is connected to connector J1. The AC voltage is rectified and filtered with a 15000uF electrolytic capacitor. The microcontroller monitors the operating voltage through the UNREG_MON pin connected to the ADC. This signal is reduced and overvoltage-protected.\nU2 provides the 5V supply voltage for the microchips requiring it. In order to keep the power dissipated in the regulator reasonable, a 15V zener diode is placed between it and the operating voltage, which dissipates approximately half of the power. The operational amplifier U1 controls the transistor on the high voltage side of the load, which means it operates in a large voltage range and is connected directly to the rectifier through the overvoltage protection formed by the zener diode D3.\nThe output voltage of the power supply is measured through the voltage divider formed by R6 and R7 and the current is measured through a separate current amplifier U3. These provide the reference voltages of the operational amplifiers as well as the signals measured by the AD converter.\nThe voltage adjustment is implemented using the operational amplifier U1A. U1A compares the measured and the set voltage to each other, and adjusts the base voltage of output transistor Q1 accordingly. In current control mode, the operational amplifier U1B compares the set and measured current. When the measured value is higher than the set value, the operation amplifier pulls down the voltage at the output transistor through the Schottky diode D4, until the measured current corresponds to the set value. Otherwise, the operational amplifier supplies maximum voltage to its output and no current flows through the diode.\nSeveral …","date":1576713600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1576713600,"objectID":"98ea4bfc9097a7b65f136b6a782f7ca4","permalink":"https://kosomon.github.io/project/powersupply/","publishdate":"2019-12-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/powersupply/","section":"project","summary":"Dual-channel floating bench power supply designed for the Electronics Workshop course at Aalto University.","tags":["Software","Featured"],"title":"Bench Power Supply","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Nintendo Entertainment System emulator with full video and audio support, which I wrote as a hobby project when I was a first year student at Aalto University.
